# Session Bookmarking Feature Proposal

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to implement session bookmarking functionality for the Voice Mode Transcript Recorder. The feature will allow users to mark important recording sessions for quick access and better organization.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
- **Sessions Table**: Robust metadata storage with quality metrics
- **Session Browser**: UI for selecting and loading historical sessions  
- **Database Inspector**: Modal interface with multiple tabs
- **Export System**: Download functionality for session transcripts

### User Workflow
1. Record sessions with whisper.cpp + LLM processing
2. Browse historical sessions via Database Inspector
3. Load sessions into main panels for review
4. Export sessions in multiple formats

## Implementation Stages

---

## Stage 1: Core Bookmarking Infrastructure
**Goal**: Add basic bookmark functionality with minimal UI changes

### Database Schema Changes
- Add `bookmarked` boolean column to existing `sessions` table
- Create database migration for existing sessions (default: false)
- Add database index for bookmark filtering performance

### Backend API Endpoints
- `POST /api/sessions/<session_id>/bookmark` - Toggle bookmark status
- `GET /api/sessions?bookmarked=true` - Filter for bookmarked sessions only
- Update existing `/api/sessions` endpoint to include bookmark status

### Basic UI Integration
- Add bookmark star icon column to Session Browser table
- Implement click handlers for bookmark toggle
- Visual feedback: filled star (bookmarked) vs outline star (not bookmarked)
- Update session data structures to include bookmark status

### TODO List - Stage 1

#### Database Changes
- [ ] Create database migration script for adding `bookmarked` column
- [ ] Add `bookmarked BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0` to sessions table
- [ ] Create index: `CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_bookmarked ON sessions(bookmarked)`
- [ ] Test migration with existing session data
- [ ] Update `init_database()` function to handle new column

#### Backend Implementation
- [ ] Create `toggle_session_bookmark(session_id)` function in app.py
- [ ] Implement `POST /api/sessions/<session_id>/bookmark` endpoint
- [ ] Update `get_sessions()` function to include bookmark status
- [ ] Add `bookmarked` query parameter support to `/api/sessions`
- [ ] Add error handling for invalid session IDs
- [ ] Write unit tests for bookmark API endpoints

#### Frontend Implementation
- [ ] Update session data structure in app.js to include `bookmarked` field

- [ ] Test bookmark toggle functionality

#### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test bookmark persistence across browser sessions
- [ ] Verify bookmark status in database after toggle
- [ ] Test with multiple sessions (some bookmarked, some not)
- [ ] Validate API error responses for edge cases
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Stage 2: Enhanced Bookmark Management
**Goal**: Add filtering, bulk operations, and improved UX

### Bookmark Filtering
- Add "Show Bookmarked Only" toggle in Session Browser
- Implement client-side and server-side filtering
- Preserve filter state across modal open/close

### Bulk Operations
- "Bookmark All Visible" button
- "Clear All Bookmarks" with confirmation dialog
- Multi-select capability for batch bookmark operations

### Current Session Bookmarking
- Add bookmark button to active session info area
- Allow bookmarking during recording
- Auto-bookmark based on session quality metrics (optional)

### TODO List - Stage 2

#### Filtering Implementation
- [ ] Add "Show Bookmarked Only" checkbox to Session Browser controls
- [ ] Implement `filterSessions(showBookmarkedOnly)` function
- [ ] Update `loadSessionsTable()` to respect filter state
- [ ] Add filter state persistence in localStorage
- [ ] Update URL parameters to reflect filter state
- [ ] Add "Clear Filter" option when bookmarked filter is active

#### Bulk Operations
- [ ] Add bulk action buttons to Session Browser header
- [ ] Implement "Bookmark All Visible Sessions" functionality
- [ ] Create "Clear All Bookmarks" with confirmation modal
- [ ] Add multi-select checkboxes to session table rows
- [ ] Implement "Bookmark Selected" and "Unbookmark Selected" actions
- [ ] Add progress indicators for bulk operations
- [ ] Create undo functionality for bulk bookmark changes

#### Current Session Features
- [ ] Add bookmark star to session info area (next to session ID)
- [ ] Implement real-time bookmark toggle during recording
- [ ] Update session info display when bookmark status changes
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcut for quick bookmark toggle (e.g., Ctrl+B)
- [ ] Create auto-bookmark rules based on duration/quality thresholds
- [ ] Add bookmark confirmation toast notifications

#### UX Improvements
- [ ] Add bookmark count to Database Inspector stats
- [ ] Implement bookmark status in session export metadata
- [ ] Add bookmark indicator to session selection dropdown
- [ ] Create hover tooltips for bookmark actions
- [ ] Add animation effects for bookmark state changes

## Stage 3: Advanced Bookmark Features
**Goal**: Add categorization, search, and smart bookmarking

### Bookmark Categories/Tags
- Add optional category field to bookmarks
- Predefined categories: "Important", "Review", "Archive", "Project"
- Custom category creation and management

### Smart Bookmarking
- Auto-bookmark sessions exceeding quality thresholds
- Bookmark sessions with high word count or long duration
- ML-based content analysis for auto-categorization

### Enhanced Search & Organization
- Search bookmarked sessions by content
- Sort bookmarks by category, date, or custom criteria
- Bookmark collections and playlists

### TODO List - Stage 3

#### Category System
- [ ] Add `bookmark_category` column to sessions table
- [ ] Create categories management interface
- [ ] Implement category dropdown in bookmark UI
- [ ] Add category-based filtering and grouping
- [ ] Create predefined category templates
- [ ] Allow custom category creation and editing
- [ ] Add category color coding and icons

#### Smart Bookmarking Engine
