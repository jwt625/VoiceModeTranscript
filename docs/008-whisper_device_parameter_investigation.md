# Whisper.cpp Device Parameter Investigation

**Date:** 2025-06-28
**Status:** Investigation in Progress
**Issue:** Whisper.cpp appears to ignore `-c` device parameter and always captures from microphone

## Problem Description

During implementation of dual audio source transcription (microphone + system audio), we discovered that whisper.cpp may be ignoring the `-c` (capture device) parameter and always listening to the default microphone, regardless of which audio device is specified.

## Observed Behavior

### Expected Behavior
- **Microphone whisper.cpp instance**: `whisper-stream -c 2` should capture from device 2 (AirPods Pro)
- **System audio whisper.cpp instance**: `whisper-stream -c 4` should capture from device 4 (BlackHole)
- **Result**: Different transcripts from different audio sources

### Actual Behavior
- **Both whisper.cpp instances** produce identical transcripts when user speaks into microphone
- **System audio levels** show correct activity in Flask app (BlackHole receiving audio)
- **Audio device enumeration** works correctly (devices are properly identified)
- **Both processes start successfully** with different `-c` parameters

## Evidence

### 1. Process Verification
```bash
ps aux | grep whisper
# Shows two processes running with different device parameters:
# whisper-stream ... -c 2  (microphone)
# whisper-stream ... -c 4  (system audio)
```

### 2. Transcript Output
When user speaks into microphone, both sources produce transcripts:
- üé§ **User** (device 2): "Test, test, can you tell a joke?"
- üîä **Assistant** (device 4): "Test, test, can you tell a joke?" ‚Üê **Should not happen**

### 3. Audio Level Monitoring
- ‚úÖ **Microphone levels**: Show activity when speaking
- ‚úÖ **System audio levels**: Show activity when system audio plays
- ‚úÖ **Device detection**: Correctly identifies BlackHole vs AirPods Pro

## Device Configuration

### BlackHole Device Issue
Two BlackHole 2ch devices appear in system:
1. **BlackHole 2ch (Direct Output)** - Output device
2. **BlackHole 2ch (Loopback Input)** - Input device for capturing system audio

**Problem**: Both devices may appear as the same device ID (4) in audio enumeration, making it difficult to select the correct loopback input device.

### Current Device Selection Logic
```python
# Auto-detection priority:
1. Devices with "loopback" in name (highest priority)
2. BlackHole devices that are NOT "output"
3. Other system audio devices (soundflower, etc.)
```

## Hypothesis

**Primary Hypothesis**: ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED** - Whisper.cpp `-c` parameter is not working as expected and both instances default to the system's default microphone input.

**Secondary Hypothesis**: The BlackHole device being selected (device 4) is not the correct loopback input device.

## Test Results

### Device Parameter Isolation Test (2025-06-29)

**Test Method**: Created `test_whisper_device_parameter.py` to run whisper.cpp with different `-c` parameters in isolation.

**Test Configuration**:
- Test 1: Default device (no `-c` parameter)
- Test 2: Explicit microphone device (`-c 2` - AirPods Pro)
- Test 3: BlackHole device (`-c 4` - BlackHole 2ch)
- Duration: 20 seconds per test
- User spoke into microphone during all tests

**Results**:
- ‚ùå **All three tests captured identical transcripts**
- ‚ùå **100% transcript overlap between different device parameters**
- ‚ùå **BlackHole test captured microphone audio instead of system audio**

**Conclusion**: **The `-c` device parameter works correctly, but PyAudio and SDL use different device ID mappings!**

### Root Cause Discovery (2025-06-29)

**Real Problem**: Device ID mapping mismatch between PyAudio (Flask app) and SDL (whisper.cpp)

**Evidence**:
- **PyAudio devices**: Device 2 = AirPods Pro, Device 4 = BlackHole 2ch
- **SDL devices**: Device 0 = AirPods Pro, Device 1 = BlackHole 2ch
- **Flask app** was sending PyAudio device IDs (2, 4) to whisper.cpp
- **whisper.cpp** only recognizes SDL device IDs (0, 1)
- **Invalid device IDs** caused whisper.cpp to fall back to default device (microphone)

**Verification**: Manual testing with correct SDL device IDs shows device selection works perfectly:
- `whisper-stream -c 0` ‚Üí Captures AirPods Pro (microphone)
- `whisper-stream -c 1` ‚Üí Captures BlackHole 2ch (system audio)

## Investigation Steps

### Completed
- [x] Verified both whisper.cpp processes are running with different `-c` parameters
- [x] Confirmed audio level monitoring works for both sources
- [x] Tested device enumeration and selection logic
- [x] Implemented dual whisper.cpp architecture with proper audio source labeling
- [x] **CONFIRMED**: Device parameter test shows whisper.cpp ignores `-c` parameter
- [x] **ROOT CAUSE FOUND**: PyAudio vs SDL device ID mapping mismatch
- [x] **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: SDL device mapper with proper ID translation

### Next Steps
- [x] Test whisper.cpp device parameter behavior in isolation
- [x] Verify which BlackHole device is the actual loopback input
- [x] Test with manual device ID specification
- [x] Investigate whisper.cpp documentation for device parameter usage

## Technical Details

### Whisper.cpp Command Structure
```bash
# Microphone instance
./whisper.cpp/build/bin/whisper-stream \
  -m ./whisper.cpp/models/ggml-base.en.bin \
  -t 6 --step 0 --length 30000 -vth 0.6 \
  -c 2

# System audio instance
./whisper.cpp/build/bin/whisper-stream \
  -m ./whisper.cpp/models/ggml-base.en.bin \
  -t 6 --step 0 --length 30000 -vth 0.6 \
  -c 4
```

### Audio Device Enumeration
```
üìã Available input devices:
   Device 0: Built-in Microphone
   Device 1: [Other device]
   Device 2: AirPods Pro
   Device 3: [Other device]
   Device 4: BlackHole 2ch
   Device 5: [Potentially another BlackHole variant]
```

## Potential Solutions

### Option 1: Fix Device Parameter ‚ö†Ô∏è **COMPLEX**
- Investigate whisper.cpp source code for device parameter handling
- Test with different audio frameworks (PortAudio, ALSA, etc.)
- Verify device ID mapping between system and whisper.cpp
- **Status**: Requires C++ development and whisper.cpp modification

### Option 2: Alternative Audio Routing ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED**
- Use system-level audio routing (Audio MIDI Setup)
- Implement separate audio capture processes (PyAudio + whisper API)
- Route audio through different virtual devices
- **Status**: Can be implemented with existing tools

### Option 3: Single Source with Post-Processing ‚ö†Ô∏è **LIMITED**
- Use single whisper.cpp instance
- Implement audio source detection in post-processing
- Use timing and context clues to separate user vs system audio
- **Status**: Cannot distinguish simultaneous audio sources

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach ‚úÖ **PRACTICAL**
- Keep whisper.cpp for microphone (works fine)
- Use OpenAI Whisper API for system audio (via PyAudio capture)
- Combine transcripts with proper source labeling
- **Status**: Leverages existing working components

## Solution Implemented ‚úÖ

### SDL Device Mapper Solution

**Approach**: Create device mapping between PyAudio (Flask app) and SDL (whisper.cpp) to use correct device IDs.

**Implementation**:
1. **Created `SDLDeviceMapper`** (`src/sdl_device_mapper.py`):
   - Gets SDL device list by running whisper.cpp briefly
   - Maps SDL device names to PyAudio device names
   - Provides bidirectional device ID translation

2. **Updated Flask app** (`app.py`):
   - Frontend now shows SDL devices (what whisper.cpp can actually use)
   - Device selection uses SDL device IDs for whisper.cpp
   - Audio level monitoring uses corresponding PyAudio device IDs
   - Proper device validation using SDL device list

3. **Updated API endpoint** (`/api/audio-devices`):
   - Returns SDL devices with mapping information
   - Includes PyAudio IDs for audio level monitoring
   - Shows device availability for both whisper.cpp and monitoring

### Device Mapping Example
```
PyAudio (Flask monitoring) ‚Üî SDL (whisper.cpp)
Device 2: AirPods Pro      ‚Üî Device 0: AirPods Pro
Device 4: BlackHole 2ch    ‚Üî Device 1: BlackHole 2ch
```

### Benefits
- ‚úÖ **Fixes the root cause** - Uses correct device IDs for whisper.cpp
- ‚úÖ **Maintains existing architecture** - No major changes needed
- ‚úÖ **Dual audio source works** - Microphone and system audio properly separated
- ‚úÖ **Audio level monitoring works** - Uses PyAudio for real-time levels
- ‚úÖ **No external dependencies** - Pure whisper.cpp solution

## Impact on Project

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Audio source labeling infrastructure** is complete
- ‚úÖ **Database schema** supports dual audio sources
- ‚úÖ **Frontend display** shows proper source indicators
- ‚úÖ **LLM processing** understands speaker roles
- ‚ùå **Actual dual audio capture** is not working due to device parameter issue

### Workaround
Currently using single audio source (microphone) with proper labeling infrastructure in place. System audio transcription can be enabled once device parameter issue is resolved.
